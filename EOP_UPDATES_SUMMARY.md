---

## Implementation Method

All changes were implemented as HTML comments within the template strings using the format:
```html
<!-- MANDATORY GENERATION INSTRUCTIONS:
- MANDATORY: [specific requirement]
- FORBIDDEN: [prohibited action]
-->
```

This ensures the AI model receives clear, contextual instructions while generating EOPs without affecting the rendered HTML output.

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test with various emergency types to verify proper adaptation
2. Verify manufacturer-specific terminology is used correctly
3. Confirm emergency codes are properly assigned
4. Check that all sections adapt to the selected emergency type
5. Validate that forbidden generic content is not generated

## Next Steps

- Monitor EOP generation quality with new instructions
- Collect feedback on emergency-specific adaptations
- Update knowledge base if additional emergency types needed
- Consider adding more manufacturer-specific details to knowledge base
