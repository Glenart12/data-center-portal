DATA CENTER MOP RISK & CET LEVEL FRAMEWORK

MOP RISK LEVEL ASSESSMENT CRITERIA

GUIDING PRINCIPLE: The final risk level is determined by the single highest-risk criterion the MOP meets. Evaluate from Level 4 down to Level 1.

Level 4 - Critical Risk: Guaranteed, widespread service outage. Affects the entire facility, a major data hall, or a core platform (e.g., "black building" power-down test, primary chiller plant replacement). Rollback may not be feasible.

Level 3 - High Risk: Service impact is expected or highly likely. Affects a Single Point of Failure (SPOF), a critical system without full redundancy, or a large fleet of systems (e.g., core router firmware upgrade, patching all hypervisors).

Level 2 - Medium Risk: Service impact is possible but not expected. Affects a redundant component of a critical system (e.g., one PDU in an A/B pair) or a small group (2-5) of non-critical systems.

Level 1 - Low Risk: No service impact is possible. Affects a single, non-critical system (e.g., cabling a new server, decommissioning a lab device).

CET SKILL LEVEL DEFINITIONS

GUIDING PRINCIPLE: This defines the minimum skill level required to perform or lead a task. A higher-level CET can always perform tasks designated for a lower level.

Level 4 - Chief Engineer: Strategic Oversight & Final Approval. Provides ultimate technical authority on critical operations. Reviews and provides final engineering approval for Level 4 MOPs. Does not typically perform hands-on work but oversees the entire operation.

Level 3 - Lead Technician: Leads Complex & High-Risk Work. Authorized to lead the execution of complex procedures. Writes, reviews, and approves Level 3 MOPs. Capable of troubleshooting critical systems under pressure and mentoring junior staff.

Level 2 - Technician: Independent Standard Work. Works independently on well-documented, standard procedures. Authorized to execute Level 2 MOPs without direct supervision and can supervise CET 1s. Possesses a comprehensive understanding of most data center systems.

Level 1 - Junior Technician: Supervised, Routine Tasks. Executes pre-defined, low-risk tasks on non-critical systems. Must work under the direct supervision of a CET 2 or higher at all times. Authorized to execute Level 1 MOPs only.

COMBINED DECISION MATRIX & LOGIC

MOP Risk Level to CET Level Mapping:
- Risk Level 4 ‚Üí CET 3 to Execute, CET 4 to Supervise/Lead, CET 4 to Approve
- Risk Level 3 ‚Üí CET 2 to Execute, CET 3 to Supervise/Lead, CET 3 to Approve
- Risk Level 2 ‚Üí CET 2 to Execute, Can work independently, CET 3 to Approve
- Risk Level 1 ‚Üí CET 1 to Execute, CET 2 to Supervise, CET 2 to Approve
