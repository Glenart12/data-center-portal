üîç RESEARCH REQUIREMENT - CRITICAL

MANDATORY: Always research unknown information before generating MOPs

What to Research (USE WEB SEARCH) - COMPREHENSIVE REQUIREMENTS:

üìö USING REFERENCE MOPs FROM KNOWLEDGE BASE

If old/reference MOPs are available in the knowledge base:

‚úÖ APPROPRIATE USE OF REFERENCE MOPs:
- Technical Content Reference: Use as examples of technical detail level and professional language
- Procedure Inspiration: Reference maintenance sequences and technical procedures for similar equipment
- Safety Language Examples: Use as examples of how safety requirements are professionally written
- Risk Assessment Examples: Reference how risks are identified and mitigation strategies described
- Technical Terminology: Use professional terminology and phrasing from reference documents
- Quality Standards: Use as examples of the level of detail and professionalism expected

üö´ NEVER USE REFERENCE MOPs FOR:
- Document Structure: Always use the exact 11-section format specified - ignore different formats in reference MOPs
- Outdated Information: Never copy old technical specifications, part numbers, or procedures without current verification
- Different Equipment: Never copy procedures from different equipment types or models
- Old Safety Standards: Always research current OSHA/NFPA requirements rather than using old standards
- Copy-Paste Content: Never directly copy sections without verification and adaptation to current requirements

‚öñÔ∏è BALANCED APPROACH:
- Research Current Information First: Always conduct comprehensive web research as primary source
- Reference for Enhancement: Use old MOPs to enhance technical language and detail level
- Verify All Technical Content: Cross-reference any information from old MOPs with current sources
- Maintain Format Compliance: Strictly follow the 11-section format regardless of reference document formats
- Update All Standards: Use current regulatory requirements, not old versions

üìã QUALITY INTEGRATION:
- Professional Language: Adopt the technical writing style and terminology from reference MOPs
- Detail Level: Match or exceed the level of technical detail shown in reference examples
- Safety Emphasis: Use reference MOPs to understand appropriate level of safety emphasis
- Procedure Structure: Learn from the logical flow and organization of procedures in reference documents

- Mitigation Strategies: How to prevent and respond to problems

DATA CENTER MOP RISK & CET LEVEL FRAMEWORK

MOP RISK LEVEL ASSESSMENT CRITERIA
GUIDING PRINCIPLE: The final risk level is determined by the single highest-risk criterion the MOP meets. Evaluate from Level 4 down to Level 1.

Level 4 - Critical Risk: Guaranteed, widespread service outage. Affects the entire facility, a major data hall, or a core platform
Level 3 - High Risk: Service impact is expected or highly likely. Affects a Single Point of Failure (SPOF)
Level 2 - Medium Risk: Service impact is possible but not expected. Affects a redundant component
Level 1 - Low Risk: No service impact is possible. Affects a single, non-critical system

CET SKILL LEVEL DEFINITIONS
Level 4 - Chief Engineer: Strategic Oversight & Final Approval
Level 3 - Lead Technician: Leads Complex & High-Risk Work
Level 2 - Technician: Independent Standard Work
Level 1 - Junior Technician: Supervised, Routine Tasks

COMBINED DECISION MATRIX
MOP Risk Level 4 ‚Üí CET 3 (Execute), CET 4 (Supervise), CET 4 (Approve)
MOP Risk Level 3 ‚Üí CET 2 (Execute), CET 3 (Supervise), CET 3 (Approve)
MOP Risk Level 2 ‚Üí CET 2 (Execute), N/A (Supervise), CET 3 (Approve)
MOP Risk Level 1 ‚Üí CET 1 (Execute), CET 2 (Supervise), CET 2 (Approve)
